<h1 align="center" id="title">Disaster Response using AI</h1>
<p>During natural disasters, rapid response is crucial to minimize casualties and damage. This project aims to build an AI-powered disaster monitoring system which will detect natural disasters as fast as possible throught real time detection.</p>

<h2>ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement</h2>
<p>During natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, wildfires, etc.), emergency response teams often struggle to assess the situation quickly. Delays in identifying the most affected areas can lead to increased casualties and inefficiencies in resource allocation.</p>

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Solution:</h3>
Build an AI-powered disaster monitoring system that:
â€¢Analyzes real-time social media posts, satellite images, and news articles to detect and assess disasters.
â€¢Summarizes the most critical information and generates priority alerts for rescue teams.
â€¢Provides location-based insights on the severity of the disaster.
